* repair the print_node in ontology.rs
* make test to verify that tbox.complete works fine
* for ontonlogy (what it should do):
    * [x] add symbols from file (json for the moment)
    * [x] add tbox items from file 
    * [x] avoid adding redundant tbox items while completing
    * read an abox file and output a consequences file (json would be good)
    * implement smart completion for abox, without generating tbox consequencees 
* that's all for the moment
