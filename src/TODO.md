- tasks that I want:
    - [x] verify tbox (for consistency)
        - [x] add consequence tree if possible
            - !!! in the mutex find a way to add new impliers
    - [x] complete tbox
    - generate consequence tree tbox
    - [x] verify abox
        - the consequence tree is valid here too
            - same with the mutex here
    - complete abox
    - generate consequence tree abox
    - rank abox
    - create graph

- see why you have duplicates on the tbox
- look up Cleora written in rust for graphs
