* for ontonlogy (what it should do):
    * [x] add symbols from file (json for the moment)
    * [x] add tbox items from file 
    * [x] avoid adding redundant tbox items while completing
    * [x] read an abox file and output a consequences file (json would be good)
    * implement smart completion for abox, without generating tbox consequencees 
    * I'm adding sqlite support, but the problems the error gestion
* that's all for the moment
* make query to get table names
